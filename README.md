# Aspect-Pulse (v1.0)

## Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis & Competitive Benchmarking Hub

Aspect-Pulse is an end-to-end data science solution designed to move beyond generic "Positive/Negative" sentiment analysis. The project focuses on Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA), extracting specific feedback on product features (Battery, Camera, Display, Performance, Value) from unstructured consumer data on Reddit and Amazon. The goal is to provide businesses with a granular, competitive comparison between flagship products.
